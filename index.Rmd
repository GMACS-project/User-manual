# Welcome {.unnumbered}

This is the online version of "*Gmacs: mastering a stock assessment for Crustaceans species*", 
a user guide book __*currently under development*__ and that aims to merge 
and synthesize all the current and past work done by the Gmacs development team
since the inception of this project.

Statistical catch age models have several advantages over simple production
type models in that age and size composition data can be used to better inform
structural features such as recruitment variability, growth variability and 
total mortality rates. There are a number of generic age-structured models in use 
today (e.g., [Stock Synthesis](https://vlab.noaa.gov/web/stock-synthesis), 
[CASAL](https://niwa.co.nz/fisheries/tools-resources/casal), ...), but there are 
very few generic size-based, or staged-based models that are used in stock assessment.

Gmacs is an integrated analysis modelling framework designed to develop size-structured
stock assessment models for crustacean species. Crab stocks of Alaska are managed
by the North Pacific Fishery Management Council ([NPFMC](http://npfmc.org)). Some 
stocks are assessed with integrated size-structured assessment models of the
form described in @punt_review_2013. Currently, most of these stocks are assessed using a stock-specific assessment model (e.g. @zheng_bristol_2014). In this context and with the aim of uniform the assessment process of these species, the Gmacs project aims to provide a software that will allow each stock to be assessed independently but using a single flexible modelling framework.

This book is designed to take you from knowing nothing about Gmacs and its utilities
